# clox (WIP)
This is my implementation of the Clox language featured in crafting interpreters by Robert Nystrom.  

## Installation:  
This interpreter is only good for evaluating arithmetic expressions right now but if you wanna try that out then:  

```console
gh repo clone Harsh5harma/clox

make compile 

```

## Usage:  

### REPL 
```console
make run  

```
